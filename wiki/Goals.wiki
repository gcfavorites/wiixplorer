=== Bugs ===
  * Random characters in empty TXT files
  * Before I can edit text in a txt file I first have to move the flashing cursor with the wiimote cursor or the onscreen keyboard (plus button) wont come up
  * When you open the onscreen keyboard on an empty line. After you finish editing and you press ok the line you were editing is deleted and your text ends up in the beginning of the next line down
  * Flashing cursor doest follow text when scrolling down with the D-PAD, what i mean is that the cursor ends up in the middle of letters or in the middle of an empty line. Meaning the cursor does not care where the letters are or if it is an empty line
