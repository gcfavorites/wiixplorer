<h2>WiiXplorer</h2>

WiiXplorer is a multi-device file explorer for the Wii by Dimok using graphics made by NeoRame and  a customized libwiigui as base for the GUI. It has several additional features to execute various of filetypes like on an actual explorer.

<h3>Known freeze issue:</h3>
A know freeze issue of the application is IOS58 as boot IOS and write access to USB2.0 combination. It's an issue inside the libogc and does not happen with any of the cIOS variants. Please do not create issue threads about that. If you get annoyed by those freezes just switch to a cIOS as boot IOS in the wiixplorer settings (e.g. d2x 249). The cIOSs are known to be stable and about 30-40% faster in read/write.
